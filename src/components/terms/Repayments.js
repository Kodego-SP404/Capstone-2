          In certain circumstances, Link Coop may (but is not obliged to)
          enforce certain terms of each Loan Contract on behalf of the Lenders
          bound to it. In doing so, Link Coop is authorized to act as an agent
          on behalf of the relevant Lenders (by its agreed terms and conditions
          with the Lenders) in taking such action. In such a case, you are
          liable to pay any attorneyâ€™s fees, filing fees, and costs if we have
          to take any legal action before the appropriate courts to enforce
          these Terms and Conditions.
