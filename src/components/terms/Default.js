          f your PDC was not honored by our depository banks, we shall inform
          you accordingly on the notice of dishonor.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you miss a payment or only partially pay the amount due, we
          (ourselves or through an agent acting on our behalf) will contact you
          and ask you why you have missed a repayment, and we will attempt to
          collect the payment.
        </li>
        <li>
          We reserve the right to contact you by any method necessary including,
          but not limited to, by letter, email, phone call, SMS, or by sending
          private messages to your affiliated social media accounts.

        <li>
          If our re-attempt to collect the funds fails two (2) days after the
          payment was due, your account will be treated as an overdue account,
          and we will continue to attempt to collect the funds. We may refer the
          missed payment to a debt collections agency (“Collections Agency”),
          who will attempt to collect the money on the Investors’ behalf.
        </li>
        <li>
          If payment still has not been made seven (7) days from the date
          payment was due, Link Coop shall charge you administration fees up to
          1.25% per month of the missed payment amount (Principal + Interest),
          which would be in addition to the loan sums due. We may also charge
          other fees to cover our tracing charges, field agents’ costs,
          litigation costs, expenses, and other such fees and in-house
          collections charges (if the loan is defaulted or becomes 3 months in
          arrears) incurred by Link Coop in the course of protecting the
          interests of the Investors.

        <li>
          Save exceptional circumstances (such circumstances being deemed
          exceptional by Link Coop in its absolute discretion from time to
          time), if you miss, fail to pay, or only partially pay three (3) or
          more consecutive monthly installments, or if you otherwise fail to
          comply with any term or condition of the Loan Conditions, the loan
          will be placed into default and we will issue you with a default
          notice and termination notice and will pursue you for the total loan
          amount outstanding, including corresponding penalty charges accrued
          while being in default. We will give you 17 days’ notice before filing
          a default on your credit reference file with the credit bureau. Please
          see our privacy policy for more details on how we disclose information
          about you.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we and/or the Collections Agency is still unable to collect the
          debt, Investors will assign their loan interests to TITLE SECURE
          (“Security Holder”) to hold as legal owner on trust for the Investors.
          Link Coop (as “Security Agent”, acting on behalf of the Security
          Holder) may take such steps as it considers necessary or desirable to
          recover the amount owed from you and/or the relevant guarantors,
          including without limitation to sell the assigned debt to a debt
          purchaser, instruct third parties to assist with the recovery process,
          and/or commence formal legal or insolvency action. If such further
          action is necessary, a collections charge will be added to your debt
          in addition to any third-party costs (including but not limited to any
          external legal fees). Such costs and charges will be passed on to you
          as the defaulting borrower (and are payable immediately). In respect
          of loans completed on or after 28 September 2015, Investors may not
          opt-out of assigning their loan parts or whole loans to TITLE SECURE.
          In respect of loans entered into before this date, Investors can
          opt-out of the transfer of their loan parts or whole loans to TITLE
          SECURE but if they do so, they undertake to Link Coop and the borrower
          (amongst others) in the Terms and Conditions for Investors to act at
          all times in a fair, transparent and proportionate manner having due
          regard to the borrower and/or guarantor, and in compliance with all
          relevant laws, regulations and best practice guidance. For the
          avoidance of doubt, Link Coop has no liability to you whatsoever for
          the conduct of Investors in any capacity and is not obliged under any
          circumstances to enforce the Investor undertaking referred to above.
          It is hereby agreed that time is of the essence about the payment of
          each monthly repayment. Accordingly, Link Coop shall, upon default the
          loan, demand immediate payment of the full amount of the loan (with
          all outstanding accrued interest) plus costs and the collections
          charges if any repayment is missed or only partially repaid (and such
          missed repayment is not remedied within 10 business days), or if you
          (or any guarantor of the loan) enter or is deemed to be likely to
          enter any formal or informal insolvency process.
