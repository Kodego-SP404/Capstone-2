          Upon registration, you are given the option to pay your regular loan
          payments through payroll deductions or auto-debit arrangements.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will also be provided with the Irrevocable Authorization and
          Direction Form (for the employer) and Authority to Deduct Form (for
          the bank) concerning your scheduled payroll deductions. These
          documents are provided to you before any loan is made, and you must
          read and agree to the terms before any loan will be made.
        </li>
        <li>
          Upon selection, you shall submit your duly signed Irrevocable
          Authorization and Direction Form or Authority to Deduct Form to Link
          Coop, subject to the approval of your employer or bank
        </li>
        <li>
          While your employer or bank facilitates repayment through convenient
          payroll deductions, you are ultimately responsible for repaying your
          loan after you have severed your employment.
        </li>
        <li>
          If for any reason, any two (2) consecutive payments are not made in
          full, then the payroll deductions will stop. We will then initiate
          actions provided under the Default section of these Terms and
          Conditions
        </li>
        <li>
          You can avoid default by notifying Link Coop and creating a special
          repayment method.
